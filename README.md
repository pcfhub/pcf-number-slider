Documentation lives on [PCFHub](https://pcfhub.dev/components/pcf-number-slider), built
from the `docs/` directory in this repository. Edit the Markdown here; the hub
recompiles it.

<!--
  This README is for someone standing in the repository — a maintainer, or
  somebody deciding whether to install the control. The hub publishes `docs/`,
  not this file, so do not duplicate the documentation here.

  The PCFHub button above promises a live demo. If `demo.fidelity` in
  `pcfhub.json` is `none`, point it at `badges/view-on-pcfhub.svg` and label it
  "View on PCFHub" instead.

  The three sections below are the ones worth writing by hand. Everything after
  them is the same in every repository and needs no edits.

  **Each carries a placeholder, and `npm run check` fails while one remains.**
  That is deliberate: an unwritten README is the first thing a visitor to the
  repository sees, and the version of this file that shipped before had worked
  examples sitting in it that read as real content. One of them — a bound
  `value` property — was wrong for every control that is not a field control,
  and reached a published repository.

  Delete these comments once the sections are written. They are instructions to
  you, and they are noise on a public page.
-->

## What it does

__WHAT_IT_DOES__

<!--
  A few paragraphs, not a feature list. Answer what the built-in control does
  not do, then spend the rest on the one or two decisions a reader would
  otherwise question — the binding shape, a behaviour that looks like a bug
  until you know why, a constraint you chose to accept.

  This is the section that saves an issue being opened.
-->

## Properties

__PROPERTIES__

<!--
  The whole configuration surface, including the defaults. `docs/api.md`
  generates its tables from the manifest; this one is hand-written, so keep it
  short enough to stay true. Read them out of the manifest rather than from
  memory, and check them against `generated/ManifestTypes.d.ts`.

  A field control's table looks like this — one row per property, and for a
  dataset control a second table for the `property-set` roles above it, giving
  both the display name a maker sees and the manifest name the code looks up by:

      | Property | Type | Usage | Default | What it controls |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | `value` | SingleLine.Text | bound, **required** | — | The column this control reads and writes |

  Follow it with the notes that do not fit a table: which languages the .resx
  ship, whether the control bundles a framework or uses the platform's, which
  `uses-feature` permissions a maker is asked for at install, and any property
  whose accepted values need spelling out.
-->

## On the hub

__ON_THE_HUB__

<!--
  What `demo.fidelity` is, and *why* it is that and not the next one up. A
  `limited` demo should say which interactions do not work there; a `full` one
  is worth explaining, because it follows from the control not reaching Web API,
  device or navigation — which is also one fewer permission prompt for the maker
  installing it.

  Mention what the presets cover. Delete this section if fidelity is `none` —
  and delete the placeholder with it, or the check will go on failing.
-->

## Install

Download the managed solution from the
[latest release](https://github.com/pcfhub/pcf-number-slider/releases/latest), or from
the component's page on the hub, and import it into your environment.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm start          # the PCF test harness
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run check      # what CI runs first: placeholders, pcfhub.json, control shape
npm run smoke      # assertions against the built bundle — see dev/
npm run harness    # serves dev/harness.html and opens it
```

`npm start` renders the control; `dev/` is for the states it cannot reach. Build
first, then `npm run smoke` for the assertions, or `npm run harness` for the
switches — field-level security, a failed business rule, a host that publishes
no theme or no column metadata, and for a dataset control, more than one page.
Both read the bundle `npm run build` wrote, and both are described in the header
of `dev/smoke.js`.

`npm run harness` serves the repository over `http://` rather than leaving you to
open the file: over `file://` a dataset fixture cannot be fetched and a module
script is refused, and both arrive as an empty control with a CORS error. It
takes `--port` and `--no-open`, and needs no dependency — `dev/serve.js` is
`node:http`. A React (virtual) control gets one too: `dev/fluent-stub.js` stands
in for the Fluent the platform would supply, and its header says exactly where
the stand-in is less capable than the real thing.

Run `npm run refreshTypes` after every manifest edit — until you do,
`context.parameters` is typed from the old manifest and `tsc` will accept code that
cannot work.

To pack the solution locally you need msbuild — either Visual Studio or the
Visual Studio Build Tools:

```bash
cd Solution
msbuild /t:build /restore /p:configuration=Release
```

Both zips land in `Solution/bin/Release`. This is the only local step that compiles
in **production** mode, so a green `npm run build` is not evidence the shipping
bundle compiles — and the pack is incremental, so delete `obj/`, `out/`,
`Solution/obj/` and `Solution/bin/` first if you intend to quote a bundle size from
it.

## Release

```bash
npm run bump -- --minor      # every version location, in one edit
npm run release -- --draft   # .release-notes.md, from the commits since the last tag
# …rewrite the notes, commit the bump…
npm run release -- --push
```

**On PowerShell, call the scripts directly** — `node scripts/version.mjs --minor`.
npm swallows a `--` flag there, warns *"Unknown cli config"*, and runs the
script with no arguments: it prints the report, changes nothing, and reads as a
bump that found nothing to do.

`npm run bump` with no argument is a **read**: it prints every place the version
lives and exits 1 if they disagree. Worth running before anything else, because
the same check otherwise happens in CI — on a Windows runner, after the pack, on
a tag that has already been pushed. `npm run check` now runs it too.

The version lives in **three** places, more in a repository holding several
controls, and they are checked against each other:

- `NumberSlider/ControlManifest.Input.xml` → `<control version="…">`
- `Solution/src/Other/Solution.xml` → `<Version>`
- `package.json` → `"version"`

Doing it by hand is still fine, and then the thing to get right is the tag:

```bash
git tag -a --cleanup=verbatim v1.2.3 -F notes.md && git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Without `--cleanup=verbatim`, git drops every `## Heading` in the notes as a
comment, silently.** `npm run release` passes it, and then reads the tag back to
confirm the headings survived — because the failure is invisible in the command
that caused it.

**The tag message is the release body, and the release body is the changelog
on the hub.** A lightweight tag gets GitHub's generated notes instead, which
for a repository without pull requests is a single compare link — and the
workflow warns when that is about to happen.

There is deliberately no `CHANGELOG.md`. The hub builds the changelog from
release notes, and `docs/changelog.md` is a hard failure in `npm run check`.

The release workflow builds, packs both solution types, and attaches them to a
GitHub Release. PCFHub picks the release up from its webhook within seconds, or
from the hourly sweep otherwise. A sync imports a draft; a person publishes it.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `NumberSlider/` | The control: manifest, entry point, CSS, localised strings |
| `Solution/` | The Dataverse solution that packages it |
| `dev/` | A stand-in host: `npm run smoke` asserts, `harness.html` shows |
| `SPEC.md` | What building this corrected, and what is verified versus read |
| `docs/` | The pages PCFHub publishes — see the comments in each file |
| `media/` | Images and video referenced from the docs |
| `pcfhub.json` | The hub's manifest: identity, links, docs path, demo |
| `scripts/` | Template setup and the CI guard that keeps it adopted |
